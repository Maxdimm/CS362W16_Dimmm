Ok, for this I ran my testdominion code for both mine and hotant's code. Then I did "git diff gameResults_dimmm.out gameResults_hotant.out". It basically showed me where the two started to diverge. I saw from the results that our code became different on line ~65 where his was able to buy smithy. Mine was not because of the way I implemented smithy so instead it got a curse. From there on our results were growing in difference because of the different cards in our decks. The results in the end had all our players with different scores which was not that suprising. This happened because of how I implemented smithy in assignment 1. Also because of how early it happened. Also the bug in my adventurer card probably increased the difference.
