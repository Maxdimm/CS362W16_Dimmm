For both random tests, I made it so it generates a random number of players and the turn order is randomly decided. It makes a 
copy of the gamestate that we will use as a comparison later. We check the new gamestate throughout to assure the card being tested
worked the way it was supposed to.  Each run is performed multiple times with different circumstances to make sure the coverage is
high enough.  The test also checks to see if there were changed to the card's implementation and it will report if there are any.  The bug
I included in A1 is still there and it will fail. Player 0 will never recieve a card when a player plays the council room card.
