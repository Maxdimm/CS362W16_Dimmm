I was testing rogersza's code. I found an issue with his implementation of the baron function. If you choose to discard an estate card, the game does not actually do it. However the game thinks you lose a card as handCound is decremented. The card is basically forgotten about because it is not discarded and gets overwritten by your next hand. The bug itself it not something that makes the game crash, however it it not how the card and the function was intended to be implemented so it is a bug nonetheless. You can reproduce the bug by just playing a game out manually and playing the baron card in the way mentioned above.
