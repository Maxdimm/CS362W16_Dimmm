In rogersza's code, the final issue I found was within his great hall implementation. The function was supposed to add an action to the players numActions but it did not end up doing that. Like his other bugs it did not crasht he code, but it did not ring true to what the great hall was supposed to do. You can reporoduce this bug like bug # 2 by just playing the card, it happens every time.
